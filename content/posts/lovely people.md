every new morning hits them  
like a hammer  
unique  
a swift motion in a blur  
that cracks open their skull  
and they desperately try to piece it back   
together with caffeine or some herbal bullshit  
they've been fooled into  
this continuous disassembling and assembling  
has left them broken  
so often beyond repair  
so miserable  
and i see them in all of their foolishness  
as they pretend to care about everything else but self  
i see them so eager to fail  
to make meaning out of failure  
and the poets and romantics among them  
even go as far as to almost make you believe  
that's it's rather glorious  
to fail  
to fall  
and all of your bruises are your collectibles,  
your precious  
still, in all of my foolishness  
i love people  
i love loving people
