yellow  
daffodils  
the sun, yellow then red and then nothing  

yellow  
stars  
twinkle then tremble  
most die with a roar worth a blink  
some  
fall  
with a yellow streak  
in a black backdrop  
urging me to make a wish  

and when the fall comes for me  
and the leaves turn yellow  
i wish  
to become a star;  
the freedom of not wanting  
not reaching but just to be.  
so yellow  
so lifeless
