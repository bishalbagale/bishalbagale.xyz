somedays,  
i doze off thinking  
how hard of an act it has become  
to just slither away  
into dreams and infinity.  
most days,  
it keeps me alive.  

somedays,  
i dream of you  
as clear as snow in bright sunlight,  
and then you melt away.  
so, it keeps me awake  
somedays,  
thinking  
how i've never seen real snow.
