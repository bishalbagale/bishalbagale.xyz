has he a clue  
of his fancy wit  
keeping me hooked  
like i am stuck with a glue to  
his cigarette lit and  
unto his lips, soft and crooked  

has he a clue  
of his curls  
tying me up in a knot  
until i'm cold and blue  
wrapped in the pearls of  
life and rot  

has he a clue  
of the love he deserves  
has he a clue  
of the love i reserve  
has he a clue  
has he a clue
