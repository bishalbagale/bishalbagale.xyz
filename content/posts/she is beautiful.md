she is beautiful  
by the books  
and the songs  
about love  

she is beautiful  
like the twilight  
sun and a  
poet's muse.  

she is beautiful  
so sings the  
river, lullaby to  
the clouds.  

she is beautiful  
like a mother,  
with loving heart  
and boundless grace.  

she is beautiful  
like the life  
itself.  

she is beautiful  
and she doesn't  
know.
