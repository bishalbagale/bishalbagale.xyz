mind  
corked  
building up toxic fumes of  

jealousy, hatred, love, you name it  
she seems calm  
nevertheless  
her body giving away no hints  
of imbalance eases itself  

in a classroom full of men  
or at least  
she fancies it so  
her cheeks  

turn pink  
a few shades lighter than her lips  
as she makes her way to the back  
passing through favoring eyes  
which she feels like is  
an eternity of  

she has no one to impress  
but herself  
and she hates it at the back  

with the wall to contrast her
